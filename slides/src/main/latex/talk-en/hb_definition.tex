\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item General idea of JMM: let's consider all the executions and forbid "bad" ones
\item Happens-before is a partial order that selects allowable reads
\item A read either sees the latest write (in {\hbbox} order)
\item Or any write via data race when multiple writes are {\hbbox}-unordered with the read
\item It must still obey other rules, especially: 17.4.8 executions and causality requirements
\end{itemize}
